{% endfor %}{% if order_status == "New" %}
	{% if shipping_cost > 0 %}
	Please go ahead to pay the giver at your earliest convenience. 
	{% elif shipping_cost == 0 %}
	Since shipping is waived, giver should ship it soon.

The order is however still in pending status, since the quantity ordered is larger than the maximum number of items per order your specified. Please approve it in your account ordering page.
